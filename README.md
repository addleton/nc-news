# Northcoders News Frontend

Welcome to my **nc_news** frontend application. I created this application to complement my [backend project](https://github.com/addleton/nc-news-be) and to showcase the skills I have learned in my time at Northcoders. You can view a live version of the application [here](https://addleton-nc-news.netlify.app/). It was developed using React with React Hooks, Axios, Material UI components, and Vite.


Although there is no authentication, you are logged in as a user and can do things such as view and comment on articles, delete your own comments, and upvote or downvote user comments.

## Run Locally

If you would like to run this application locally, you can do so by following these steps

`$ git clone https://github.com/addleton/nc-news.git`  
`$ cd nc-news`

Next install dependencies

`$ npm install`

Run the app

`$ npm run dev`

## Requirements

Node.js v20.5.0
